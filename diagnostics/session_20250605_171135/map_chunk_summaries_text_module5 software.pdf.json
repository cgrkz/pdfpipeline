  "Mutation testing is a fault-based testing technique, categorized as White Box testing, primarily used for Unit Testing. It involves intentionally introducing errors – or “mutations” – into source code to assess the effectiveness of existing test cases. The core objective is to identify code segments that are not adequately tested, uncover hidden defects, and discover new types of errors.  Mutation testing utilizes tools like Judy, Jester, and PIT to generate these “mutant” programs by making small changes to the original code, such as altering constants, operators, or statement order.\n\nThe process involves creating multiple versions of the code – the original and the mutated – and then executing the existing test suite against each. If a test case fails when run against a mutant, it indicates a weakness in the test suite and the need for improvement. Conversely, if a mutant survives, meaning the test case passes despite the introduced change, it signifies that the test case is insufficient.  Mutation testing helps calculate a “mutation score,” which reflects the percentage of mutations detected.\n\nDifferent types of mutations exist, including decision mutations (altering logical operators), value mutations (changing constant values), and statement mutations (modifying code structure).  Cyclomatic complexity, a metric measuring code complexity based on control flow paths, is also relevant; higher complexity suggests a greater need for thorough testing.  Ultimately, mutation testing enhances test suite quality by ensuring comprehensive coverage and identifying potentially overlooked vulnerabilities within the software.",
