Regression testing is a critical process within software development, employed to ensure stability and functionality after modifications, bug fixes, or new feature additions. This segment details various approaches to regression testing, emphasizing its necessity for maintaining software quality. Primarily, regression testing occurs when changes are made to existing features, aiming to verify that those features continue to operate as expected.  Several techniques are outlined, beginning with “Retest All,” a resource-intensive method involving executing every existing test case – deemed costly due to its extensive time commitment.  Alternative approaches include “Regression Test Selection,” which strategically chooses test cases based on impact analysis, categorizing them as reusable or obsolete. Prioritization of test cases, focusing on frequently used and critical business functionalities, further streamlines the process.  Different types of regression testing are also discussed, including Unit Regression Testing (URT), concentrating solely on modified sections, Regional Regression Testing (RRT), examining affected modules, and Full Regression Testing (FRT), which comprehensively tests all features before major releases. A robust Test Plan is crucial, encompassing product analysis, test strategy definition, objective setting, and logistical considerations. This plan is dynamic, adapting to project progression and serving as a blueprint for testing activities. Finally, the segment highlights the iterative nature of regression testing, often executed in phases – master, phase, and specific – to manage scope and complexity, with a focus on verifying functionality, user interface, performance, security, compatibility, and usability.

This segment details a comprehensive approach to software testing, outlining eight key steps and emphasizing collaboration between development and testing teams. Initially, defining test objectives involves identifying functionality (core operations, UI, performance, security, and compatibility) and establishing desired outcomes. Subsequently, establishing test criteria is crucial, encompassing both suspension criteria (triggering a halt in testing based on failure rates, such as 40% of test cases failing) and exit criteria (benchmarks for successful project completion, like 90% test case pass rate). Resource planning involves identifying all necessary elements—human, equipment, and materials—to support the project.  The testing environment must accurately reflect real-world user conditions, necessitating collaboration between build and test managers.  A crucial step is scheduling and estimation, breaking down the project into tasks with allocated time and effort, illustrated by a timeline with specific milestones.  Test deliverables, including test plans, scripts, results, and defect reports, are essential for documenting the testing process.  Finally, test design focuses on creating detailed test cases – outlining test scenarios and steps— utilizing templates that capture information like test case ID, description, preconditions, test data, expected results, and actual results, alongside status and comments. The segment highlights the importance of thorough test case design, exemplified by techniques like boundary value analysis and equivalence class partitioning, and concludes with an example test case illustrating the process.
